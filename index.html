		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<h2>Here are three things to know about me:</h2>

		<div class="about-content">
			<div>


				<p>1)  I currently live in Orlando, FL, but I have lived all over the USA: North Carolina, South Carolina,
					California, New Mexico, Georgia, and New York. I also lived in Costa Rica for a year when I was a child,
				    but I don't remember much about that! The pictures are amazing, however, and I would love to return
					for a visit.</p>


				<p>2)  I have worked in many career fields: restaurant industry, office manager for a thriving real estate
					company(where I developed a passion for graphic design), and even a poker champion! I was also a jewelry
					maker and designer (my main focus was creating Mala Necklaces, but I also created custom gifts such as 
					bridesmaid presents).</p>

				<p> 3)  I was in a random accident in 2016 that left me unable to walk without a cane, and lots of pain. This 
					accident changed my life in so many ways! After trying to turn my passion (making beautiful jewelry) into 
					a career, I have decided to study software engineering. I still love designing and making jewelry as a hobby,
					but the cost of materials/time spent did not equate into a viable pay. I also can't return to the restaurant 
					industry because of my leg, but even though I enjoyed the challenging, fast-paced aspect of the job and made 
					many good friends, I never wanted to grow old/retire from that career. There is a silver lining to everything 
				    in life, and my accident has made me so motivated, hungry, strong, and focused.</p>

				<!-- bullet lists about me-->

				<h2>Here are some of my skills that will benefit you:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I never take an opportunity for granted! Life has humbled me greatly, and I have gained a new
						perspective and appreciation for everything.</li>
					<li>My professional communication skills: over ten years in the restaurant industry, depending on
						happy customers to make a living has made me able to keep a cool demeanor no matter how
						frustrated I may be. I
						was also an office manager at a high-end real estate office, so I interacted with people in a
						very professional atmosphere as well. </li>
					<li>I'm very eager to learn: my brain works in a way that I cannot stop learning about a subject
						that I'm interested in until I know every single detail. People have always told me that I
						should try-out for Jeopardy because I have a lot of knowledge about a lot of subjects! </li>
					<li>My problem-solving mindset- I've been winning at complex games such as chess and Tetris since I
						was a
						small child. Later in life, I became very interested in poker and after studying the intricacies
						of the game(such as math, patience, discipline, equity(pot odds, risk vs. reward), and more!).
						Many former and current poker players have chosen software engineering because these skills
						serve them very well in this career field.</li>
				</ul>
