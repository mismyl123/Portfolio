My Professional Portfolio

This project is my own professional portfolio as a web developer. It began as an assignment for Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion program. I will be updating this page frequently as I continue to learn and also adding projects that I've created.

Currently my portfolio is a single page with four sections and a navigation bar at the top that links to each section.

#Hello Section

This section is a basic welcome message, with a greeting for the visitor, a short summary, and a picture of me.

#About Me

This section is a more detailed bio about who I am. It includes my professional history, some personal history, and why I am learning coding, and what makes me passionate about this career path I've embarked on. 

#Contact

This section of the site offers several links that a person can use to get in touch with me. It includes links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email. I also added a functional email form that visitors can fill out in order to send emails directly from the site.

#Projects

This section is new and right now it only contains placeholders for future projects. I intend to update it with capstone projects that I really enjoy building and will highlight my work most.
